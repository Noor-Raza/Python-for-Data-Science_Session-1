# Python for Data Science

# Assignment-2

**Description:**
Assignment branch contains a set of basic Python exercises aimed at practicing fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, list comprehension, and functions.
The exercises are designed to be easy to follow, with explanations and examples provided for each.

## List of Exercises:

### Exercise 1: FizzBuzz Function
    
    FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem. The function takes a number n and prints all numbers from 1 to n.
    However, for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz", for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz", and for multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".
    For all other numbers, it simply prints the number itself.

### Exercise 2: Basic Data Filtering
    
    In this exercise, a list containing mixed data types (integers, strings, and floats) is created.
    The task is to filter the list and create a new list that contains only integers using list comprehension.
    This exercise helps practice list manipulation and filtering based on data types.
    
### Exercise 3: Simple To-Do List
    
    This exercise simulates a basic to-do list application.
    The program starts with an empty list, and two functions are defined:
        - add_task(task): Adds a task to the to-do list.
        - show_tasks(): Displays all tasks currently in the list.
    Users can call add_task() to add new tasks and show_tasks() to print the entire list of tasks.

### Exercise 4: Temperature Converter
    
    This exercise involves converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit using a function.
    The function celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius) applies the conversion formula and prints the results for a list of temperatures in Celsius.
